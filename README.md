# Oculus-Scraper
Small script which fetches all jobs from:

  "https://www.oculus.com/careers/". 

If you then run it on a later date it will give you a number on how many positions that have been removed i.e. number of people that have been employed since first execution of script. The "jobs.csv" file is used to keep track of the positions. It contains all the positions that was retrieved the last time the script ran.

Here is a diagram from monitoring the web page between 2018-5-10 and 2018-8-13:

Data: [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kumdql7F5p1-Cgk-XYuXEXTdjkmjm6qTMQiz26Cy2Oc/edit#gid=0)

If you interpolate the data it would mean that Oculus currently is hiring at a pace of around 900 people per year into VR.
